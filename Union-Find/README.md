# Union Find and Dynamic Connectivity

Goal: Design efficient data structure for union-find.

Number of objects N can be huge. 

Number of operations M can be huge.

Find queries and union commands may be intermixed.

Quick find: complextity of: initialization = N, Union = N,find operation = 1

Union find: complexity of: initialization = N, Union = N,find operation = N
